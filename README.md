# SLR_Parser
This is slr parser made for Compiler Lecture
The scope of the task was to implement syntax analyzer, but our group even created a flexible analyzer. If you receive a token, and if you receive a code, each entry point is as follows.

token version:
python syntax_analyzer.py test1.txt

code(extended) version:
python syntax_analyzer_code.py test1_code.txt

We have made 4 test cases with the same results in code and token versions, respectively.
